======
Halite
======

(Code-name) Halite is a Salt GUI. `This project has been retired
<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/salt-users/rmMWLSaw0RY/N5PGRqDkwQgJ>`_.

For best results, it is recommended to use Halite with the develop branch of Salt.
Halite is, however, known to work with Salt version greater than ``Hydrogen``.
To install the develop branch of Salt:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone -b develop https://github.com/saltstack/salt.git
  $ cd salt && python setup.py install
  $ salt-master --version
  $ salt-master -l debug

This version of Halite is designed to work out of the box with SaltStack when
the PyPi package version of Halite is installed. The PyPi (PIP) version of Halite
is a minified version tailored for this purpose. (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/halite)
Halite makes use of the ``Bottle`` (WSGI) web framework. Servers that are tested and
known to work with Halite are ``paste``, ``cherrypy`` and ``gevent``.

To pip install Halite.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install -U halite

This purpose of the repository is to enable development of custom versions of the
UI that could be deployed with different servers, different configurations, etc.
and also for development of future features for the Salt packaged version.

Features
========

Highstate Consistency Check
---------------------------

Halite can poll for highstate consistency. This is similar to executing
``salt \* state.highstate test=True`` and checking for the results.
Polling is turned ``OFF`` by default.

To switch polling ``ON``, navigate to the ``Preferences`` tab and check
``highStateCheck.performCheck``. The poll timer can be adjusted using
``highStateCheck.intervalSeconds`` and is set to 300 seconds (5 minutes) by
default. Once these settings are updated, click ``Update`` and reload the page.
These options are depicted in the screenshot below.

.. image:: screenshots/HighstatePollSettings.png

Highstate consistency check results can be seen on the minion view. Minions
that have inconsistent state have a flag next to them as shown in the screenshot.

.. image:: screenshots/MinionWithFlag.png

The ``Highstate`` subtab for each minion displays the state items that lack
consistency. All of the inconsistent items will be displayed here for easy
visualization. The screenshot below shows a message that might appear
when highstate consistency is disturbed.

.. image:: screenshots/HighstateSubtab.png

The cog icon that appears in the ``Monitor`` section can be clicked to perform
highstate consistency check. The on demand check only works in the
scenario where polling is off. In the case where polling is switched on (as
discussed above) the cog icon will appear to be spinning (and does not respond
to clicks).

Installation quickstart
=======================

This section explains installation of the development version of Halite.
If you are interested in installing Halite as an end user, please follow the
`tutorial
<http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/halite.html>`_ instead.

* Setup permissions for users who will use Halite
For example in master config:

.. code-block:: bash

  external_auth:
    pam:
      myusername:
          - .*
          - '@runner'
          - '@wheel'

Halite uses the runner ``manage.present`` to get the status of minions so runner
permissions are required.  Currently Halite allows but does not require any
wheel modules.

* Clone the Halite repository::

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/saltstack/halite


* Run halite/halite/server_bottle.py (use with -h option to get parameters)

The simplest approach is to run the server with it dynamically generating
the main web app load page (main.html) in coffescript mode, where the coffeescript
is transpiled to javascript on the fly. In each case the appropriate server package
must be installed.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./server_bottle.py -d -C -l debug -s cherrypy

    $ ./server_bottle.py -d -C -l debug -s paste

    $ ./server_bottle.py -d -C -l debug -s gevent



* Navigate HTML5 compliant browser to http://localhost:8080/app

* Login
The default eauth method is 'pam'. To change, go to the ``Preferences`` page.

Documentation
=============

Preferences
-----------

The navbar has a login form. Enter the eauth username and password to login to salt.

.. image:: screenshots/LoggedOut.png

Once logged in, the navbar will display the username highlighted in blue and a logout button.
To logout click on the ``Logout`` button.

.. image:: screenshots/LoggedIn.png



Click on the SaltStack logo to go to the preferences page

.. image:: screenshots/Preferences.png

On this page, one can change the eauth method to something other than 'pam' such
as 'ldap'.

Check ``fetchGrains`` if you want grains data to be loaded when Halite loads.
Checking ``preloadJobCache`` will fetch all previously completed, cached jobs.

Once all changes are made, click ``Update`` and refresh the browser page.

Commands
--------

To navigate to the console, view click on the ``Console`` tab.

.. image:: screenshots/HomeConsole.png

This view has two sections. The ``Command`` section and the ``Monitor`` section.
The ``Command`` section is collapsed by default. Clicking on the downward chevron will
expand the ``Command`` section.

The top section of the Console view has controls for entering basic salt commands.
The target field will target minions with the command selected. There is ping button
with the bullhorn icon and the action menu has some preselected common commands.

Expanded Commands
-----------------

.. image:: screenshots/CommandForm.png

Click on the downward chevron button to expand the ``Command`` form with additional
fields for entering any salt module function. To enter "runner" functions, prepend
"runner." to the function name. For example, "runner.manage.status". To enter wheel
functions, prepend "wheel." to the wheel function name. For example, "wheel.config.values".
For commands that require arguments, enter them in the arguments fields. The number of argument
fields equals the number of arguments accepted by the function.

Click on the ``Execute`` button or press the Return key to execute the command.

You can choose the ``Target Format`` which will be used by the ``Target`` field to target minions.

There is a ping button with the bullhorn icon and the Macro menu has some preselected commands
for "speed dial".

There is also a history feature which appears as a book icon on the top right corner of the ``Command`` panel.

Checking ``Live Doc Search`` will show the documentation related to the command being
entered in the ``Function`` field. Un-check it to conserve screen real estate.

Monitors
--------

The bottom section of the console view has monitor view buttons. Each button will
show panels with the associated information.

* Command Monitor

Shows panels, one per command that has been executed by this user on this console.
Clicking on the dropdown button will show the associated job ids that have been
run with this command and the completion status via an icon.
Red is fail, green is success.
Clicking on the button on the panel will rerun the command.

.. image:: screenshots/CommandMonitor.png

* Job Monitor

Shows panels, one per job that has been run by any minion associated with this
master. Clicking on the associated dropdown button with expand to show ``Result`` and ``Event`` data.
Selecting the ``Result`` button will show the returner and return data
for each minion targeted by the job.

.. image:: screenshots/JobMonitor.png

Selecting the ``Event`` button will show the events associated with the job.

.. image:: screenshots/JobMonitorEvent.png

* Minion Monitor

Shows panels, one per minion that have keys associated with this master. The minion
panels have icons to show the up/down status of the minion and the grains status.
Selecting dropdown buttons will show grains data as well as minion (not job) generated events.

.. image:: screenshots/MinionMonitor.png



With the ``Grains`` button selected, one can see all the grains for the minion.

.. image:: screenshots/MinionGrains.png




* Event Monitor

Shows panels, one per event associated with this Master.

Deployment
----------

There are two approaches to deploying Halite.

1) Use it from Salt.
The 0.17 release of salt will run halite automatically if the Halite package is
installed. So for example, after installing SaltStack, one can install the Halite
python package with

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install -U halite

Configure the master config for halite as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

  halite:
      level: 'debug'
      server: 'cherrypy'
      host: '0.0.0.0'
      port: '8080'
      cors: False
      tls: True
      certpath: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt'
      keypath: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.key'
      pempath: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.pem'

The "cherrypy" and "gevent" servers require the certpath and keypath files to run tls/ssl.
The .crt file holds the public cert and the .key file holds the private key. Whereas
the "paste" server requires a single .pem file that contains both the cert and key.
This can be created simply by concatenating the .crt and .key files.

If you want to use a self signed cert, you can create one using the Salt ``tls`` module

.. code-block:: bash

  salt '*' tls.create_ca_signed_cert test localhost

When using self signed certs, browsers will need approval before accepting the cert.
If the web application page has been cached with a non https version of the app, then
the browser cache will have to be cleared before it will recognize and prompt to
accept the self signed certificate.

You will also need to configure the eauth method to be used by users of the Web UI.
See quickstart above for an example.

Install the appropriate HTTP WSGI server selected in the master config above. In
this case it is "cherrypy". The other tested servers are "paste" and "gevent". The server
must be multi-threaded, asynchronous, or multi-processing in order to support
the Server Sent Event (SSE) streaming connection used by the Web UI.

Restart the SaltStack Master and navigate your HTML5 compliant browser to
https://localhost:8080/app or however you have configured your master above.

If you have problems look for "Halite:" in the SaltStack master log output.

Customized Deployment
---------------------

The Halite Github repository provides a skeleton framework for building your own custom
deployment. One can run the default bottle.py framework from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./server_bottle.py -g
  $ ./server_bottle.py -s cherrypy


or from a python application

.. code-block:: python

  import halite

  halite.start()


The full set of options is given by

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./server_bottle.py -h
  usage: server_bottle.py [-h] [-l {info,debug,critical,warning,error}]
                        [-s SERVER] [-a HOST] [-p PORT] [-b BASE] [-x] [-t]
                        [-c CERT] [-k KEY] [-e PEM] [-g] [-f LOAD] [-C] [-d]

  Runs localhost web application wsgi service on given host address and port.
  Default host:port is 0.0.0.0:8080. (0.0.0.0 is any interface on localhost)

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -l {info,debug,critical,warning,error}, --level {info,debug,critical,warning,error}
                          Logging level.
    -s SERVER, --server SERVER
                          Web application WSGI server type.
    -a HOST, --host HOST  Web application WSGI server ip host address.
    -p PORT, --port PORT  Web application WSGI server ip port.
    -b BASE, --base BASE  Base Url path prefix for client side web application.
    -x, --cors            Enable CORS Cross Origin Resource Sharing on server.
    -t, --tls             Use TLS/SSL (https).
    -c CERT, --cert CERT  File path to tls/ssl cacert certificate file.
    -k KEY, --key KEY     File path to tls/ssl private key file.
    -e PEM, --pem PEM     File path to tls/ssl pem file with both cert and key.
    -g, --gen             Generate web app load file. Default is 'app/main.html'
                          or if provided the file specified by -f option.
    -f LOAD, --load LOAD  Filepath to save generated web app load file upon -g
                          option.
    -C, --coffee          Upon -g option generate to load coffeescript.
    -d, --devel           Development mode.

The HTTP server provides two functions.

1) Provide content delivery network for the base load of the web application static
content such as html and javascript files.

2) Provide dynamic REST API interface to salt/client/api.py module that is used by
the web application via AJAX and SSE connections. Because SSE and CORS
(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) are not universally supported even among HTML5 compliant
browsers, a single server has to serve both the static content and the rest API.
An alternative approach would be to to use a web socket to stream the events,
this would not require CORS, so it may be a future option for Halite.

To deploy with apache, modify ``server_bottle.startServer`` so it creates the app but
does not call ``bottle.run`` on it but returns it to MOD_WSGI.
See (http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/deployment.html) for other details in using bottle.py
with Apache and Mod_wsgi.

Doing a custom deployment with other frameworks like Django, etc. would involve
replicating the endpoints from server_bottle.

Architecture
------------

The following diagram illustrates how the various pieces to Halite interact.

.. image:: diagrams/HaliteArchitecture.png

Testing
-------

To run the karma jasmine ``unit test`` runner

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd halite
  $ karma start karma_unit.conf.js

To run the protractor ``e2e test`` runner first start up a web server. More information
about using protractor can be found on their website.

Make sure that the end to end test is setup to login to Halite

.. code-block:: bash
  $ vim halite/test/spec-e2e/credentials.coffee

In that file change the following

.. code-block:: coffeescript

   login =
       username: 'your_halite_username'
       password: 'your_halite_password'

Now you can run the tests using the following commands.
Make sure you have the ``webdriver-manager`` started.
More info can be found on the `Protractor <https://github.com/angular/protractor>`_
webpage.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd halite
  $ protractor protractor.conf.js

To run the ``functional`` tests make sure you have the Python ``webtest``
and ``nose`` modules installed.

Enter your credentials and the minion name in a new file called
``halite/test/functional/config/override.conf``

.. code-block:: python

  [login]
  username = your_user_name
  password = your_password

  [minions]
  apache = minion_connected_to_this_master

The functional tests can be run via ``nose``.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd halite
  $ nosetests

You might have to build the distribution (for development)

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd halite
   $ ./prep_dist.py


Subtree can be fetched by running ``git subtree pull --prefix=halite/lattice lattice master --squash``
